LawDocsGen is a software to automate the creation of legal documents based on an HTML template.

This is a POC using Python and HTML (for templates), using a simple document (called "Declaração" in Brazilian Portuguese), but it could be anything, really. 

Yet, for those curious about it, it doesn't have an UI yet. It may or may not come in the future as another project (repository). Feel free to make yours.

IMPORTANT: This project was in collaboration with Izabella Malta, which coordinated the necessary steps as Scrum Master or Project Manager, using Kanban.

Special note: the utils/classes folder is not yet in use, though the project could be remade using classes and using this folder. I will keep it for example's sake.

Cheers

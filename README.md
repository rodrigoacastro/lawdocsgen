LawDocsGen is a software to automate the creation of legal documents based on an HTML template.

This is a POC using Python and HTML (for templates), using a simple document (called "Declaração" in Brazilian Portuguese), but it could be anything, really. 

Yet, for those curious about it, it doesn't have an UI yet. It may or may not come in the future as another project (repository). Feel free to make yours.

Cheers

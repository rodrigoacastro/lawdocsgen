## **LawDocsGen**

LawDocsGen is a software to automate the creation of legal documents based on an HTML template. This is my first attempt to contribute to this field, so I hope it helps someone out there who cannot afford some expensive suite.

This is a POC using Python and HTML (for templates), using a simple document (called "Declaração" in Brazilian Portuguese), but it could be anything, really. I used the _skeleton.py_ file to model the initial development and reach its purpose, as well as an external drafting of the potential changes in the future (database, cloud, etc). These changes have _not_ been implemented to this project, for those who are asking. So it remains a POC (Proof of Concept).

Yet, for those curious about it, it doesn't have an UI yet. It may or may not come in the future as another project (repository). Feel free to make yours.
__________________________
_IMPORTANT_: This project was made in collaboration with Izabella Malta, who coordinated the necessary steps using the Agile Framework. Unfortunately, due to technical issues, the project was lost in Jira. The result persists here, proving it existed. 

_Special note_: the utils/classes folder is not yet in use, though the project could be remade using classes and using this folder. I will keep it for example's sake.

And for those seeking to contribute to opensource projects, this project has fulfilled its purpose and it's no longer being maintained. You can still clone it and make your changes, as long as you cite the original source.

Cheers
